My role in the TISlab is primarily as an SQL and Python developer in the N3C and CLAD ETL efforts, harmonizing data into OMOP. My previous work in Cardiology involved harmonizing and analyzing RCT and EHR data using R and various clustering algorithms. I have a past career in industry software development involving C, C++, Java, Perl, Javascript and others in UNIX/Linux environments. Summer weekends often see me on long bike rides and spending time with my wife.
