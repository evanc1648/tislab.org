I'm a biomedical informatics researcher with interests in rare disease research and COVID research. Experienced in biological research, EHR data, OMOP, and utilizing our exciting tools on real world data (e.g. using semantic similarity to identify undiagnosed rare disease patients/patients with diseases lacking diagnostic codes in EHR data).
